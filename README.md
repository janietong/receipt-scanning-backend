# receipt-scanning-backend
This Receipt Scanning App enables users to upload a receipt image and extracts key details including the vendor name, line items (name and price of purchased items), and the total amount. The frontend is built with **Next.js** and styled using Tailwind CSS, while the backend is powered by **Flask** and integrates **OpenAI's GPT-based API** for OCR functionality. The app is designed to process standard image formats (JPG, PNG) and provide a user-friendly JSON output of the extracted data.

To set up the project, clone the repository and install dependencies for both the frontend (`npm install`) and backend (`pip install flask flask-cors openai`). For the backend, add your OpenAI API key in a `.env` file. Start the servers with `npm run dev` for the frontend and `python main.py` for the backend. The frontend will run on `localhost:3000`, and the backend will be available on `localhost:5000`. For deployment, the frontend can be hosted on Vercel and the backend on Render, with the appropriate API keys and URLs configured.

I chose OpenAI's GPT-based API for its advanced text extraction capabilities, enabling precise formatting and accurate parsing of structured data. However, the app assumes receipts are clear, high-quality images in English, and backend performance may be impacted by large image uploads due to base64 encoding. This app is a powerful tool for automating receipt data processing while providing a seamless user experience.
